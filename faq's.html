                <div class="accordion-item-desc">Please don`t worry, there is a way that might help you track your
                    Phone:
                    1. Go to https://www.google.com/android/find and sign in to your Google Account.
                    2. If you have more than one device, click the lost device at the top of the screen.
                    3. The device gets a notification.
                    4. On the map, see about where the device is.
                    a. The location is approximate and might not be accurate.
                    b. If your device can't be found, you'll see its last known location, if available.
                    5. Pick what you want to do. If needed, first click Enable lock & erase.a. Play soundRings your
                    device
                    at full volume for 5 minutes, even if it's set to silent or vibrate.b. LockLocks your device with
                    your
                    PIN, pattern, or password. If you don't have a lock, you can set one. To help someone return your
                    device
                    to you, you can add a message or phone number to the lock screen.c. ErasePermanently deletes all
                    data on
                    your device (but might not delete SD cards). After you erase, Find My Device won't work on the
                    device.
                    Important: If you find your device after erasing, you'll likely need your Google Account password to
                    use
                    it again. Learn about device protection.

                    to the connection request on "Receiver". The connection is successfully established. Or tap the QR
                    code in the lower left corner of "Sender" and scan it with "Receiver";

                    phone, and tap "Send". The file will be transferred to the mobile phone of the receiver.
